## AlphaAgents

This is a personal project developed by Marcus Izumi, in an attempt to implement a prototype for multi-agent framework as discussed in the paper written by BlackRock research scientists in August this year (2025):
- *AlphaAgents: Large Language Model based Multi-Agents for Equity Portfolio Constructions*
- https://arxiv.org/html/2508.11152v1

## Personal Background / Motivation

Recently, I completed a software engineer internship at an investment bank, and was exposed to equity systems and how technology really intersects with financial markets - and then I heard about this paper.

When reading through the paper, I noticed how there was not a lot of technical explanation or code snippets on how the framework was built and explored, so I decided to try to implement them, with the little knowledge I have as a college student.

The personal goal here, for me, is to be familaized with multi-agentic frameworks, as well as to get a sense of how fundamental, technical and macro analysis are done during the valuation of their stocks.

This project is far from mathematical or production-level for now.

The current implementation focuses on architecture, agent interaction, and reasoning flow, not on financial accuracy or quantitative modeling.

Early agents use deterministic, rule-based logic and mocked data to simulate analyst behavior, serving as a foundation for learning and experimentation.

As development progresses, the system may evolve toward more data-driven or LLM-integrated reasoning, but the emphasis remains on understanding multi-agent orchestration rather than achieving trading performance.
