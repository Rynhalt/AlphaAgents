## AlphaAgents

This is a personal project developed by Marcus Izumi in an attemps to implement a prototype for multi-agent framework as discussed in the paper written by BlackRock in August this year:
- *AlphaAgents: Large Language Model based Multi-Agents for Equity Portfolio Constructions*
- https://arxiv.org/html/2508.11152v1

## Personal Background / Motivation

Recently, I have completed a software engineer internship at an investment bank, and was exposed to equity systems and how technology really intersects with financial markets - and then I heard about this paper.

When reading through the paper, I noticed how there was not a lot of technical explanation or code snippets on how the framework was built and explored, so I decided to try to implement them, with the little knowledge I have as a college student.

The personal goal here, for me, is to be familaized with multi-agentic workflow, as well as get a sense of how fundamental, technical and macro analysis are done during the valuation of their stocks.
